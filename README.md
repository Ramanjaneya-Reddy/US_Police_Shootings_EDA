# US_Police_Shootings
This project is done by exploratory data analysis using R programming.
R Studio is used in this project to develop the visualizations.
Various libraries are made to develop the project.


                                                                    Introduction
This simple project is a US Police Shootings â€“ EDA in R. 
This is a data visualization project developed in R programming. 
Police shootings have become a prominent issue in the United States in recent years, with numerous cases drawing national attention and sparking protests. 
The deaths of individuals such as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Daunte Wright have raised concerns about the use of force by law enforcement and its disproportionate impact on communities of color. 
In order to better understand the patterns and factors contributing to police shootings, exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be a valuable tool.

In this project, we conducted an EDA of US police shooting data using the R programming language. 
Our goal was to explore the characteristics of police shootings and identify potential relationships between variables such as race, location, and use of force.
By analyzing this data, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to police shootings and inform efforts to improve public safety and reduce the use of excessive force by law enforcement.

1. Data collection: We will obtain publicly available data on police shootings in the United States from reliable sources such as The Washington Post and the Mapping Police Violence Project.
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the data to ensure its accuracy and suitability for analysis. This may involve removing duplicate records, dealing with missing values, and transforming variables to facilitate analysis.
3. Exploratory data analysis: We will use various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the characteristics of police shootings, such as frequency distributions, high charts, histograms, and box plots.
4. Hypothesis testing: We will conduct statistical tests to explore potential relationships between variables, such as the correlation between race and the use of force.
5. Interpretation and reporting: We will interpret our findings and report our results in a clear and concise manner, including data visualizations and tables where appropriate.

Males are far more likely to be killed in police shootings than females as presented. It has also been established in this work that the median ages of those killed in police killings vary in different communities. 
The analysis also shows most people killed by police were armed with handguns, but there is also a significant number of unarmed people.
The number of people who were not fleeing and whose deaths were not captured on camera is very high and is the cause of most concern.
Besides, this work also contains the states and cities where most police killings occur.

The purpose of this study is to shed some light on the ongoing scenario regarding police shootings. Any instance of police shooting is put under immense scrutiny. This analysis only aims to provide necessary information based on the publicly available dataset to the concerned authority and is in no way intended for providing a verdict on the situation. The hope is that the analysis included can be of substantial assistance to the concerned authority in making plans and policies to address the situation. In the future, police shootings data for a large number of years will be collected and analyzed to check the statistical significance of the difference in police shootings based on demographics.
